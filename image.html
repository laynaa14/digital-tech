<h1>Lossy and Lossless Images</h1>
<h2>The Difference Between Lossy and Lossless Compression on Images</h2>
<p>The main difference between lossy and lossless compression is 
</br>the quality of the photo. Lossless images have a higher quality 
</br>than lossy images which means that the image is much clearer whilst 
</br>lossy images have lower quality which equals to blurrier photos.
<h2>Why is it Important for Web Designers to Compress Image Files</h2>
<p>The main reasons as to why it is important to compress image files when
</br>making a website is because it takes a longer amount of time to load
</br>when you have a bigger file uploaded.
