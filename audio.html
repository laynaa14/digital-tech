<h1>Lossless and Lossy Audio</h1>
<h2>Lossless Audio Files<h2>
<h3>Examples of Lossless File Types</h3>
<ul>
<li>FLAC</li>
<li>WAV</li>
<li>ALAC</li>
<li>WMA Lossless</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Use Lossless File Formats</h3>
<p>Lossless files are also known as "RAW" format. This means that the audio
</br>or image still contains most of it's original data. Having the original data
</br>means that the quality of the media is much higher which means that the
</br>photo or audio will be much clearer. </p>
<h2>Lossy Audio Files</h2>
<h3>Examples of Lossy Type Files</h3>
<ul>
<li>OGG</li>
<li>MP4</li>
<li>MP3</li>
</ul>
<h3>How Does Lossy Compression Work</h3>
<p>Lossy compression is the complete opposite of lossless formats. Instead of 
</br>a file containing it's original data, specific information is reduced.
<h3>Why use Lossy File Formats?</h3>
<p>Although having lossless audio is much better and clearer, lossy compression is
</br>helful. Since lossy compression loses certain information, it's file size is smaller
</br> and takes up less space.
